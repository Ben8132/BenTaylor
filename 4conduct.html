										<h1>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>This page should reflect on own professional conduct through the module, and wider&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
									<p>It should include reference to the BCS code of conduct</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>You make IT for everyone</h2>
									<p>The <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/"> BCS Code of Conduct </a> states that IT should be devleoped with consideration for all people who it could affect and to make it as accessible to as many people as possible. This means that beneficial IT technology should be equally accesible to all people, it shouldnt be offensive or discriminatory to any groups based of ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, religion, age or disability</p>
									<p>I have followed this rule as no software I have ever developed has been discriminatory, or been purposfully restricted to specific groups.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Show what you know, learn what you don't</h2>
									<p>The <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/"> BCS Code of Conduct </a> states that you should only undertake professional work or servic that is within your competence, to not claim to a level of competance that is not posessed, ensure you have proper knowledge of legal requirments regarding your work and to accept criticisms and alternate viewpoints of work but not to make false criticisms to damage or defame the work of others.</p>
									<p>I have taken feedback from the work in my modules and used it to improve my skills and knowledge for my studies, I have not defamed anyone or their work, meaning I have not borken this rule.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Respect the organisation or individual you work for</h2>
									<p>The <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/"> BCS Code of Conduct </a> states that workers have a duty to their employers to carry out their work with due dilligence, avoid conflict with relevant authoritys within the workplace, not to share confidential information to third parties wihtout legal reason or permission from employers, not to withold or misrepresent the information of a product, system or service.</p>
									<p>I have completed the course and lab work that has been assigned to me, I have not broken NTU rules or policies and have thereofre followed this code.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Keep IT real. Keep IT professional. Pass IT on.</h2>
									<p>The <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/"> BCS Code of Conduct </a> states that members have a personal duty to maintain and uphold the reputation of the profession, BCS and to help improve the reputation through partipation in its development and by helping to support other people within the field.</p>
									<p>During my pieces of group coursework I have worked with my team in a professioanl manner helping to support gaps in their knowledge to better succeed with out tasks, therefore I argue that I have properly followed this rule.</p>
